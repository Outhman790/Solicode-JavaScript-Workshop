# 💻 Solicode JavaScript Workshop

## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains a small educational website aimed at practicing core **JavaScript** concepts. The page features a side navigation bar listing several exercises. Selecting one reveals:

* 🧹 A short statement
* 🧪 A demo area
* 💡 The JavaScript code used to solve the task

The goal of this project is to help **beginners** learn fundamental programming structures—such as **variables**, **conditions**, **loops**, **arrays**, and **functions**—through **interactive examples**. The design is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## 🧠 Available Exercises

The application currently includes the following demos:

1. 🔄 **Permutation de deux nombres** – Swap the values of two inputs
2. 📅 **Valider une date** – Check if a day/month/year combination forms a valid date
3. ✖️ **Table de multiplication** – Display the multiplication table of a selected number
4. 🎯 **Devine le nombre** – Simple number guessing game (1–50)
5. 🔷 **Losange en étoiles** – Draw a diamond of stars based on chosen size
6. 🧮 **Calculatrice** – Perform basic arithmetic on two numbers
7. 🧹 **Recherche et suppression dans une chaîne** – Search for and optionally remove a word from a sentence
8. 📊 **Tri d’un tableau** – Sort an array of numbers without using `Array.sort`
9. 🐡 **Compter le nombre de voyelles** – Count the vowels in a sentence
10. 🔍 **Recherche dans un tableau** – Look for a specific value inside an array

Each exercise dynamically displays the **JavaScript code snippet** used to perform the solution.
